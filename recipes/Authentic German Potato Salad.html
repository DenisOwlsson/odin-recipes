    <h2>Desription</h2>
    <p>This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. Everyone, German or not, loves it. 
        It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. 
        There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p>
    <p>Unlike mayonnaise-based American potato salads, German potato salad is tossed in a vinegar-based dressing made with bacon drippings. 
        It is usually served warm instead of cold, but some people prefer to serve it at room temperature.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: We recommend using waxy potatoes (such as New Potatoes) because they hold their shape well. Yukon Gold, an all-purpose variety, is also a good choice. </li>
        <li>Bacon: Bacon (and its grease) adds tons of meaty flavor to the hearty German potato salad. </li>
        <li>Onion: An onion, cooked in bacon grease, lends even more complexity and flavor. </li>
        <li>Vinegar: White vinegar adds tanginess that cuts through the richness from the potatoes and bacon. </li>
        <li>Sugar: A bit of white sugar gives the savory potato salad subtle sweetness. </li>
        <li>Seasonings and herbs: This German potato salad recipe is seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and add water to cover by at least 1 to 2 inches; bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes 
            are easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes, turning as needed. 
            Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and crumble when cool enough to handle. Leave bacon grease in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook onion in the bacon grease over medium heat until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add vinegar, sugar, water, salt, and pepper to the pan and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add potatoes, and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer warm potato salad to a serving dish and sprinkle remaining bacon over top. Garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
